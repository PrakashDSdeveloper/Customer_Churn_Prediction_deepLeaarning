**The objective is to predict customer churn in the telecom business, understanding the reasons behind customer attrition. A deep learning model will be constructed for 
this purpose, and the performance of the model will be assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.**

Brief Model Explanation:
The deep learning model is designed to analyze patterns and factors contributing to customer churn in the telecom industry. 
Leveraging advanced neural network architectures, the model learns intricate relationships within the data to identify signals indicative of potential churn. 
By utilizing features such as customer usage patterns, service interactions, and account history, the model aims to accurately predict which customers are likely to 
leave the business. The precision, recall, and F1-score metrics will be employed to evaluate the model's effectiveness in capturing both the positive instances of 
churn and minimizing false positives, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities.
